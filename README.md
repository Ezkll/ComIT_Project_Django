### ComIT_Project
Course Project Implementing learnings from the ComIT Course: Web Development with Python

### Project Ideas
While I have been considering a number of projects, I want to emphasize on development time and being able to present something that is of value.

- IoT Django web interface with Raspberry Pi
- Auction Site
- API interface with Pokemon Go
- Student Portal
- Restaurant Reservation with POS (with AI/ML integration) (prolly too ambitious)
- Simple Web based POS with Inventory Management`
